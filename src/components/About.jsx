        Despite being an English major, I found my love for programming during
        my first year in high school. I joined competitive programming, learned
        C++ as my first programming language, then picked up other languages
        like Python, Javascript, Java, HTML, CSS,... along the way.&nbsp; I am
        currently striving to become an Artificial Intelligence Researcher,
        specialized in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision with a
        touch of Robotics and Human-Computer Interaction. I am experience in
        implementing Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, as well as
        deploying them to production using Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, and
        Flask. Website Development is my side hussle.
